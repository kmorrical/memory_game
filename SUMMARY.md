Summary of coding exercise

Instructions for starting/testing:

I would highly recommend running an npm install after cloning this branch. Then you should be able to start with npm run start

Things I was able to accomplish:

*making game to match cards

*writing unit/component tests for MOST of items
  
*adding in redux/state management (even though it was probably not necessary in small app)



Things I would do if I had more time:

*added a loading spinner while posts were loading

*added better testing for redux/thunk/middleware. this was a little bit of a learning curve for me.

*added better testing for everything!

*made UI even better/more responsive for different screen sizes
